Set of convoy vehicles that have a MLC number
Need to go from A to B
What are the different routes they can take and the costs for each route


Combine Route Fetch and Bridge Parse into 1 API call (for easy/efficiency)
Re-work the algorithm that finds bridges in a route to be more accurate.
Look into ambush avoidance algorithms and solutions.
Build an example algorithm that roughly follows Dr. Ricks game diagram. 
Fork Tony's code (or start from scratch) to implement the algorithm for a POC
??? Maybe connect ambush avoidance to UI somehow that allows for human/ai players


ASK WILL TO ADD BRIDGE WAY ID TO ALL NODES
Current update is combine all endpoints into 1 as we need all info:
	Valhalla routes and trip polyline parsing
	OSM/NBI bridge data from routes
	Ambush avoidance scoring
